 More info at https://doitpsway.com/automatic-jira-ticket-creation-for-azure-application-admin-consent-requests

 Script should be periodically run
 Script checks admin consent requests, if some new (unprocessed) is found, new Jira ticket will be created
 Processed requests are saved into XML file
 When request is allowed/denied, corresponding Jira ticket is closed and comment is added
